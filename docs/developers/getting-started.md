## Building on Aztec

There are two common ways that developers can start building on Aztec:

1. Build a user-facing application that connects to the Aztec network via the TypeScript SDK.
2. Build an Aztec Connector contract that connects the Aztec network to Ethereum smart contracts.

We are also working on Noir, a domain specific language that can be used to develop ZK-provable programs. Scroll down for more details.

:::info
The Aztec core engineering team has a regular release cadence that will occasionally introduce breaking changes. Updates are typically applied to Testnet on Thursdays, which are tested and monitored over the weekend and would be pushed to Mainnet afterwards.

We are working on making this process more transparent. Feel free to [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any queries.

## Testnet Information

### Configuration

Aztec maintains a Testnet environment that mimics Ethereum, enabling more comprehensive testing of projects built on Aztec.

To make use of the Testnet:

1. Connect Metamask (or other Ethereum wallet) to the Testnet:

| Properties      | Network Details                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network name    | Aztec Testnet                                             |
| RPC URL         | https://aztec-connect-testnet-eth-host.aztec.network:8545 |
| Chain ID        | 677868                                                    |
| Currency symbol | ETH                                                       |

2. Get Testnet funds:
   - Use the [Testnet faucet](https://aztec-connect-testnet-faucet.aztec.network/)
   - For larger amounts of Testnet ETH, [get in touch](#get-in-touch)

After connecting to the Testnet, you can try out Aztec projects on the Testnet such as [zk.money (Testnet)](https://aztec-connect-testnet.zk.money/), [Aztec CLI](https://github.com/critesjosh/azteccli) and the [Minimal Frontend](https://aztec-frontend-boilerplate.netlify.app/) that involve account registrations, deposits, transfers, withdrawals and more on the Aztec network.

The testnet doesn't have a block explorer at the moment. A simple way to deploy contracts on the testnet and interact with existing deployed contracts is via [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org). To do this, connect Metamask to the testnet, connect Remix and Metamask and send transactions through the Remix "Deploy and Run Transactions" tab.

For the status and details of the Aztec Testnet infrastructure, check the [Testnet Falafel Status API](https://api.aztec.network/aztec-connect-testnet/falafel/status).

### Deployed Aztec Connector contracts

If you are developing with the SDK / on multi-step connectors that involve interaction with other existing connectors, you may come across the need to retrieve details of connectors already deployed on the Testnet (e.g. `bridgeAddressId`). There are currently two ways to do so:

#### Aztec Frontend Boilerplate

After logging in on the [Minimal Frontend](https://aztec-frontend-boilerplate.netlify.app/), you will see a "Log Bridges" button which logs connector details in the browser console.

#### Foundry Script

Alternatively, you can read from the connector data provider contract directly by running a script from the [Aztec Connector contracts repository](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges). Check [this section](./bridges#testnet-deployment-info) for more details.

## Building with the SDK

### Setup

To start using the SDK, install it in your project by running:

```shell
yarn add @aztec/sdk
```

And import it into your project:

```ts
import { createAztecSdk } from "@aztec/sdk";
```

For a proper walkthrough of setting up the SDK, check the [SDK Setup page](../sdk/usage/setup.mdx).

### Example Code

To learn how the SDK works in action, the [CLI page](./cli) provides a detailed breakdown of the [Aztec CLI](https://github.com/critesjosh/azteccli) tool powered by the SDK.

If you are building a web interface, you might also find the [Frontend Boilerplate](https://github.com/Globallager/aztec-frontend-boilerplate) useful as a starting point.

:::tip
By default, Aztec transactions could take up to a few hours to settle on the Testnet like on Mainnet. If you want transactions to settle quickly, be sure to set `TxSettlementTime` as `INSTANT`.

`INSTANT` transactions pay higher fees in Testnet ETH in exchange for settlement within minutes rather than hours.

## Building an Aztec Connector Contract

The [Aztec Connector Contracts page](./connectors) covers how to develop an Aztec Connector contract in great detail.

The [Aztec Connector Contracts repository](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges) has the most up to date information and materials for creating a connector contract.
