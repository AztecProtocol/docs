`aztec-node`’s sole purpose is to provide an easy-to-use interface to all the backend services we have. These services are [`p2pClient`](./p2p.md), [`worldStateSynchroniser`](./world-state.md), [`merkleTreeDB`](./merkle-tree.md), [`worldStateSynchroniser`](./world-state.md) and [`sequencer`](./sequencer-client.md). 

`aztec-node` can be thought of as Aztec’s geth.
