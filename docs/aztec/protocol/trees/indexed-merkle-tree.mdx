We're implementing an "Indexed Merkle Tree" for efficient non-membership proofs, which we'll need for our Nullifiers Tree.

Hereâ€™s the paper with the idea: https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1263.pdf

An indexed Merkle tree is a variant of the basic Merkle tree where the leaf structure changes slightly. Each leaf in the indexed Merkle tree not only stores some value $v \in \mathbb{F}$ but also points to the leaf with the next highest value:

$$
\textsf{leaf} = \{v, i_{\textsf{next}}, v_{\textsf{next}}\}.
$$

where $i_{\textsf{next}}$ is the index of the leaf with the next higher value $v_{\textsf{next}} > v$. By design, we assume that there are no leaves in the tree with a value between the range $(v, v_{\textsf{next}})$. The highest-valued leaf points at $i_{next} = 0, v_{next} = 0$, by convension.

Let us look at a toy example of nullifier insertions in an indexed Merkle tree of depth 3.

1. Initial state

2. Add a new value $v=30$

<Image img={require("/img/index-merkle-tree-2.png")} />

3. Add a new value $v=10$

<Image img={require("/img/index-merkle-tree-3.png")} />

4. Add a new value $v=20$

<Image img={require("/img/index-merkle-tree-4.png")} />

5. Add a new value $v=50$

## Analysis - Constraint counts

### Insertion

- Hash the old leaf: `oldLeaf = h(0, 0, 0)` (for example).
- Prove the old leaf existed in the tree: `n` hashes.
- Check the new leaf belongs in the slot it's being inserted into: `2` range checks.
  - If (`oldLeaf.nextInd == 0`):
    - Special case, we're inserting at the very end, so the new leaf must be the highest-valued so far.
    - `assert(oldLeaf.val < newLeaf.val)`
  - Else:
    - `assert(oldLeaf.val < newLeaf.val)`
    - `assert(oldLeaf.nextVal > newLeaf.val)`
- Copy over the old leaf's `next` values to the new leaf:
  - `assert(oldLeaf.nextInd == newLeaf.nextInd)`
  - `assert(oldLeaf.nextVal == newLeaf.nextVal)`
- Update the old leaf to point to the new leaf: `updatedLeaf = h(0, 30, 1)`.
  - `assert(updatedLeaf.nextInd == newLeaf.ind)`
  - `assert(updatedLeaf.nextVal == newLeaf.val)`
- Replace the `updatedLeaf` in the tree: `n` hashes.
- Hash the new leaf: `newLeaf = h(30, 0, 0)`.
- Add the `newLeaf` to the tree: `n` hashes.

#### Number of insertion constraints, in total:

- `3n` hashes of 2 field elements (where `n` is the height of the tree).
- `3` hashes of 3 field elements.
- `2` range checks.
- A handful of equality constraints.

### Non-membership proof

Suppose we want to show that the value `20` doesn't exist in the tree. We just reveal the leaf which 'steps over' `20`. I.e. the leaf whose value is less than `20`, but whose nextVal is greater than `20`. Call this leaf the `loLeaf`.

- hash the low leaf: `loLeaf = h(10, 1, 30)`.
- Prove the low leaf exists in the tree: `n` hashes.
- Check the non leaf 'would have' belonged in the range given by the low leaf: `2` range checks.
  - If (`loLeaf.nextInd == 0`):
    - Special case, the low leaf is at the very end, so the non leaf must be higher than all values in the tree:
    - `assert(loLeaf.val < nonLeaf.val)`
  - Else:
    - `assert(loLeaf.val < nonLeaf.val)`
    - `assert(loLeaf.nextVal > nonLeaf.val)`

#### Number of non-membership proof constraints, in total:

- `n` hashes of 2 field elements (where `n` is the height of the tree).
- `1` hash of 3 field elements.
- `2` range checks.
- A handful of equality constraints.

### Doing a non-membership check, then an insertion of that value

We combine the logic of the above two sections, where `oldLeaf` is renamed to `loLeaf` throughout, and `nonLeaf` is renamed to `newLeaf`. We can actually make some savings.

- Hash the low leaf.
- Prove the low leaf exists in the tree: `n` hashes.
- Check the new leaf 'would have' belonged in the range given by the low leaf: `2` range checks.
  - If (`loLeaf.nextInd == 0`):
    - Special case, the low leaf is at the very end, so the non leaf must be higher than all values in the tree:
    - `assert(loLeaf.val < newLeaf.val)`
  - Else:
    - `assert(loLeaf.val < newLeaf.val)`
    - `assert(loLeaf.nextVal > newLeaf.val)`
- Copy over the old leaf's `next` values to the new leaf:
  - `assert(oldLeaf.nextInd == newLeaf.nextInd)`
  - `assert(oldLeaf.nextVal == newLeaf.nextVal)`
- Update the old leaf to point to the new leaf, to create `updatedLeaf`.
  - `assert(updatedLeaf.nextInd == newLeaf.ind)`
  - `assert(updatedLeaf.nextVal == newLeaf.val)`
- Replace the `updatedLeaf` in the tree: `n` hashes.
- Hash the new leaf.
- Add the `newLeaf` to the tree: `n` hashes.

#### Number of constraints, in total:

- `3n` hashes of 2 field elements (where `n` is the height of the tree).
- `3` hashes of 3 field elements.
- `2` range checks.
- A handful of equality constraints.

### Batch insertion!

With this new indexed nullifier tree, we can perform batch insertions, which saves on the number of hashes required. We can't batch the checking or updating of the 'pointer' leaves, but we can batch the insertion of brand-new leaves, by inserting them as a little subtree at the next available positions in the tree (from left to right).

#### Number of constraints, in total:

Suppose we want to insert `b` leaves (assuming insertion of a neat power of 2, to make this illustrative maths simpler):

- `2nb` hashes of 2 field elements (where `n` is the height of the tree), to check and update the pointer leaves.
- `(b - 1) + (n - log_2(b) + 1) = n + b - log_2(b)` hashes of 2 field elements (to insert the new leaves as a batch).
- `3b` hashes of 3 field elements.
- `2b` range checks.
- `b` x "A handful of equality constraints".

## Benefits

We can compare this kind of tree to a sparse merkle tree of height 254 (as was used in the old Aztec Connect system).

Previous nullifier tree depth: `254`.

To update one leaf in the old, sparse nullifier tree, we needed to verify two membership proofs:

- that the old leaf value for the given nullifier was 0 (i.e. it's unspent); and
- that the updated leaf value for the given nullifier is 1 (marking it as spent).

#### Number of constraints using the old sparse nullifier tree, in total:

- `2 * 254 = 508` hashes of 2 field elements.
- A handful of equality constraints

### Concrete comparison

Ignoring range checks, and overestimating that hashing of 3 field elements approximates to `2` hashes of 2 field elements, the approximate difference between batch insertion of a 254-heigh tree, versus an `n` heigh tree is:

`508b - [2nb + (n + b - log_2(b)) + 6b]` hashes of 2 field elements, minus `2b` range checks.
Simplified: `501b - 2nb - n + log_2(b)`.

Suppose we choose a nullifier tree height of `n = 45`, for Aztec, and an illustrative nullifier batch size of `b = 2048`. Then the approximate saving is:

`841,694` hashes (minus 4096 range checks).

`1,040,384` hashes under the old approach, versus `198,690` (plus 4096 range checks). Roughly a 5x saving.
